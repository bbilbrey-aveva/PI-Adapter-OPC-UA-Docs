## Connection

The OPC UA adapter uses the binary opc.tcp protocol to communicate with the OPC UA servers. As part of the OPC UA server and client establishing a secure connection, each one sends its X.509-type certificate to the other for verification. Upon verification of the certificates, the server and client establish a secure connection.

For more information on secure connections, see [PI Adapter for OPC UA security configuration](xref:PIAdapterForOPCUASecurityConfiguration).
