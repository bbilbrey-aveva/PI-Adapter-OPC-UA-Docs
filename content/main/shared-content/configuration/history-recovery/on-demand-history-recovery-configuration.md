# On-demand history recovery configuration

The AVEVA Adapter supports performing history recovery on-demand by specifying start and end time.

## Configure history recovery

1. Start any of the [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools) capable of making HTTP requests.
2. Run a `POST` command with the `Id` of the history recovery, and the `startTime` and `endTime` to the following endpoint: `http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/HistoryRecoveries`.

    Example using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -d "{ \"Id\":\"TestRecovery\", \"startTime\":\"2021-03-29T14:00:30Z\", \"endTime\":\"2021-03-29T15:00:15Z\"  }" -X POST "http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/HistoryRecoveries"
    ```

    **Note:**

    - `5590` is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value.
    - If you do not specify an Id, the endpoint generates a unique Id.

## History recovery parameters

Parameter | Type| Description
---------|----------|---------
 **Id** | `string` | The Id of the history recovery **Note:** You cannot run multiple history recoveries with the same Id.
 **StartTime** | `datetime` | Time when the first data items are collected. **Note:** Timestamps are interpreted into the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time standard. OSIsoft recommends the following format for entering a startTime in a curl command: *YYYY-MM-DD*T*HH:MM:SS*Z.
 **EndTime** | `datetime`| Time when the last data items are collected. **Note:** Timestamps are interpreted into the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time standard. OSIsoft recommends the following format for entering a endTime in a curl command: *YYYY-MM-DD*T*HH:MM:SS*Z.
| **Checkpoint** | `datetime` | The latest timestamp that the history recovery has completed with the range being between **startTime** and **endTime**.
| **Items** | `double` | The amount of data selection items in the history recovery operation.
| **RecoveredEvents** | `double` | Number of events that the history recovery found on the data source.
| **Progress** | `double` | Progress of the history recovery (number of data items found through the history recovery).
| **Status** | `enum` | Status of the history recovery.The following statuses are available:*Active* - The operation is currently in progress*Complete* - The operation has been completed*Canceled* - The operation has been canceled*Failed* - The operation failed
| **Errors** | `string` | Errors encountered during the history recovery.

## History recovery status example

```json
[
 { 
   "Id": "HistoryRecovery1", 
   "StartTime": "2021-01-09T05:55:00.0", 
   "EndTime": "2021-01-26T13:20:00.0", 
   "CheckPoint": "2021-01-13T14:55:00.0", 
   "Items": 7000, 
   "RecoveredEvents": 800000, 
   "Progress": 20, 
   "Status": "Active", 
   "Errors": null 
 }
] 
```

**Note:** The result of the history recovery operation is added to the `<componentId>_historyRecoveries.json` file.

| api/v1/configuration/_\<componentId>_/historyRecoveries/_\<operationId>_/resume | POST | Resumes canceled or failed history recovery operation (`202`) from the checkpoint**Note:** If the `<operationId>` is not found, a 404 HTTP error message will be returned  | 

**Note:** Replace _\<componentId>_ with the Id of your adapter component. Replace _\<operationId>_ with the Id of the history recovery operation for which you want to perform the action.
