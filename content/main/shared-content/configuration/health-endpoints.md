# Health endpoints

You can configure AVEVA Adapters to produce and store health data at a designated health endpoint. You can use health data to ensure that your adapters are running properly and that data flows to the configured OMF endpoints.

For more information about adapter health, see [Adapter health](xref:AdapterHealth).

## Configure health endpoint

A health endpoint designates an OMF endpoint where adapter health information is sent. You can configure multiple health endpoints.

Complete the following steps to configure health endpoints. Use the `PUT` method in conjunction with the `http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/healthendpoints` REST endpoint to initialize the configuration.

1. Use a text editor to create an empty text file.

2. Copy and paste an example configuration for health endpoints into the file.

    For sample JSON, see [Examples](#examples).

3. Update the example JSON parameters for your environment.

    For a table of all available parameters, see [Health endpoint parameters](#health-endpoint-parameters).

4. Save the file. For example, as `ConfigureHealthEndpoints.json`.

5. Open a command line session. Change directory to the location of `ConfigureHealthEndpoints.json`.

6. Enter the following cURL command (which uses the `PUT` method) to initialize the health endpoint configuration.

    ```bash
    curl -d "@ConfigureHealthEndpoints.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT "http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/healthendpoints"
    ```

    **Notes:**
  
    * If you installed the adapter to listen on a non-default port, update `5590` to the port number in use.
    * For a list of other REST operations you can perform, like updating or replacing a health endpoints configuration, see [REST URLs](#rest-urls).

## Health endpoints schema

The full schema definition for the health endpoint configuration is in the `System_HealthEndpoints_schema.json` file located in one of the following folders:

Windows: `%ProgramFiles%\OSIsoft\Adapters\<AdapterName>\Schemas`

Linux: `/opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/<AdapterName>/Schemas`

## Health endpoint parameters

The following parameters are available for configuring health endpoints:

| Parameter                       | Required                            | Type      | Description                                        |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Id**                          | Optional                            | `string`    | Uniquely identifies the endpoint. This can be any alphanumeric string. If left blank, a unique value is generated automatically. Allowed value: any string identifier Default value: new GUID|
| **Endpoint**                    | Required                            | `string`    | The URL of the OMF endpoint to receive this health data Allowed value: well-formed http or https endpoint string Default: `null`|
| **Username**                    | Required for PI Web API endpoints   | `string`    | The username used to authenticate with a PI Web API OMF endpoint _AVEVA Server:_Allowed value: any string Default: `null`|
| **Password**                    | Required for PI Web API endpoints   | `string`    | The password used to authenticate with a PI Web API OMF endpoint _AVEVA Server:_Allowed value: any string Default: `null`|
| **ClientId**                    | Required for AVEVA Data Hub endpoints          | `string`    | The client ID used for authentication with an AVEVA Data Hub OMF endpoint Allowed value: any string Default: `null` |
| **ClientSecret**                | Required for AVEVA Data Hub endpoints          | `string`    | The client secret used for authentication with an AVEVA Data Hub OMF endpoint Allowed value: any string Default: `null`|
| **TokenEndpoint** | Optional for AVEVA Data Hub endpoints | `string` | Retrieves an AVEVA Data Hub token from an alternative endpoint Allowed value: well-formed http or https endpoint string Default value: `null` |
| **ValidateEndpointCertificate** | Optional                            | `boolean`      | Disables verification of destination security certificate. Use for testing only with self-signed certificates; OSIsoft recommends keeping this set to the default, true, in production environments. Allowed value: `true` or `false`Default value: `true`|

## Examples

### AVEVA Data Hub endpoint

```code
{
    "Id": "AVEVA Data Hub",
    "Endpoint": "https://<AVEVA Data Hub OMF endpoint>",
    "ClientId": "<clientid>",
    "ClientSecret": "<clientsecret>"
}
```

### PI Web API endpoint

```code
{
    "Id": "PI Web API",
    "Endpoint": "https://<pi web AVEVA Server>:<port>/piwebapi/omf/",
    "UserName": "<username>",
    "Password": "<password>"
}
```

**Note:** When you use an adapter with a PI Web API health endpoint, the AF structure is required. If the elements are deleted, the adapter recreates the elements; if the account used to authenticate to the PI Web API has its permissions removed on the AF Server, the adapter retries sending health data to the PI Web API until the permissions are restored.

## REST URLs

| Relative URL                                              | HTTP verb | Action               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints      | GET       | Gets all configured health endpoints |
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints      | DELETE    | Deletes all configured health endpoints |
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints      | POST      | Adds an array of health endpoints or a single endpoint. Fails if any endpoint already exists |
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints      | PUT       | Replaces all health endpoints. **Note:** Requires an array of endpoints |
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints     | PATCH     | Allows partial updating of configured health endpoints**Note:** The request must be an array containing one or more health endpoints. Each health endpoint in the array must include its **Id**.  |
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints/\<Id\> | GET       | Gets configured health endpoint by \<Id\> |
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints/\<Id\>| DELETE     | Deletes configured health endpoint by \<Id\> |
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints/\<Id\> | PUT       | Updates or creates a new health endpoint with the specified \<Id\> |
| api/v1/configuration/system/healthEndpoints/\<Id\> | PATCH     | Allows partial updating of configured health endpoint by \<Id\> |

**Note:** Replace \<Id\> with the Id of the health endpoint.
